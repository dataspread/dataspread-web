/**
 * Represents a CHP fkp. The style properties for paragraph and character runs
 * are stored in fkps. There are PAP fkps for paragraph properties and CHP fkps
 * for character run properties. The first part of the fkp for both CHP and PAP
 * fkps consists of an array of 4 byte int offsets that represent a
 * Paragraph's or Character run's text offset in the main stream. The ending
 * offset is the next value in the array. For example, if an fkp has X number of
 * Paragraph's stored in it then there are (x + 1) 4 byte ints in the beginning
 * array. The number X is determined by the last byte in a 512 byte fkp.
 *
 * CHP and PAP fkps also store the compressed styles(grpprl) that correspond to
 * the offsets on the front of the fkp. The offset of the grpprls is determined
 * differently for CHP fkps and PAP fkps.
